      Gamble on colors! So much fun! Which color will it land on?! Can't cheat, it's colors! Colors don't talk, colors don't cheat. Why should gamble on our color gambling dapp? Here's why!
      <br/>
      Private: Chromastake does not allow users to know how much each person bets
      <br />
      Fair: Winning color is calculated within an impartial, open source smart contract instead of through a 3rd party, hidden API
      <br />
      Light: No database needed in addition to ethereum
      <br/>
      <br/>
